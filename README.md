# Machine-Learning-Engineering-Projects-by-Kariston-Luiz
My name is Kariston and I'm currently Analytics Engineering at a Fintech focused on financial and banking services for small and medium enterprises. I am passionate about data and I am a Data Engineering and Machine Learning enthusiast, intending to pursue this career in the future. I have Bachelor and Master's degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics from the State University of Londrina (UEL) and currently an MBA student in Machine Learning in Production at UFSCar.

In summary, I'm a data professional who always seeks to improve my knowledge, contribute to research, and develop the best sustainable, data-driven, solutions and ecosystem by using Data Foundations.

In this repository, we can find some of the projects developed using Data Engineering techniques focused on Machine Learning Pipeline. Remembering that this repository is constantly updated.
