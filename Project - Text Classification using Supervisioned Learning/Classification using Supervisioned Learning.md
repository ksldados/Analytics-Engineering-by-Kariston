In this project, we are going to use the free Reddit API to extract some posts by Web Scraping about Data Science, Machine Learning, Physics, Astronomy and Conspiracy. 

Once these data have been extracted, we will create a pipeline for pre-processing these data and we will use dimensionality reduction techniques to later train 3 classification models, KNN, RandomForest and Logistic Regression. 

After that, we will analyze the performance of each one of them by the Confusion Matrix and we will select the best model for these types of classification.

## Starting the Project

Firstly, we've to create a free API connection to the site https://reddit.com in order to load the data used in this project. Basically, it will be a Web Scraping.
