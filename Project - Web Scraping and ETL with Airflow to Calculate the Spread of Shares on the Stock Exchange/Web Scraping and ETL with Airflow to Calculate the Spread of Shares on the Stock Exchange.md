# Web Scraping and ETL with Airflow to Calculate the Spread of Shares on the Stock Exchange

Let's build a data pipeline with Apache Airflow. 
In this project our goal will be to build an ETL process to extract data from the web via web scraping, organize and transform the data, calculate the spread (we will work with financial data) and then generate the output. 
All this will be done automatically with Airflow.

# Starting the Project

After installing and configure the Apache Airflow on your PC, we should start the Airflow using the terminal.
